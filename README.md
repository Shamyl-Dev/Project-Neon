# Project-Neon
The final build for a game me and my team worked on!
To play download the release from GitHub -> unzip -> run neon.exe

RECOMMENDED:
- Please watch your ears and immediately turn the game down in your volume manager to about 20% (adjust as needed).
- If you get stuck on any level find the black arrows and stand on them (if this does not work walk to the end of the level and then come back to the arrows)

NOTE:
- THIS GAME IS MADE TO BE HARD AND BUGGY, it is the first game I ever worked on, and rather than saying its buggy I can say it's intended for bug abusing and speedrunners :) (totally not buggy cause it and my team's first time)


THANK YOU FOR EVEN LOOKING AT THIS AND
ENJOY THE GAME!
